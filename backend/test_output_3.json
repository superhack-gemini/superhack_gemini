  "research_summary": "The Seattle Seahawks' path to Super Bowl XLVIII was a masterclass in resilience and strategic dominance. After a stellar 13-3 regular season in 2013, securing the NFC West title and home-field advantage, the Seahawks faced a gauntlet of playoff contenders. Their journey began on January 11, 2014, with a hard-fought 23-15 victory over the New Orleans Saints in the Divisional Round, a game defined by Marshawn Lynch's powerful runs and a stifling defensive performance led by the 'Legion of Boom.' The NFC Championship game on January 19th against their arch-rivals, the San Francisco 49ers, was an instant classic, a brutal, back-and-forth affair culminating in a nail-biting 23-17 Seahawks victory sealed by Richard Sherman's game-winning pass deflection in the end zone. This win sent the Seahawks to their second Super Bowl in franchise history, setting the stage for a clash against Peyton Manning and the Denver Broncos.",
